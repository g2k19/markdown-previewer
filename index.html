# Welcome to my Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other things you can do:

You can show off your code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.

```
// Or use this for a multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
if (firstLine == '```' && lastLine == '```') {
return multiLineCode;
}
}
```

You can also make text **bold** or _italic_ or... **_both!_**
And feel free to ~~crossing stuff out~~.

And even tables:

A Header | Another Header | More Headers
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
- Some are bulleted.
- With different indentation levels.
- That look like this.


1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:
